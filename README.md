iOS Backup Extractor
====================

`ios_backup_extractor` is a free command line utility to extract media files (photos and videos)
from a local _unencrypted_ iOS device backup. This type of backup is typically created by Apple's [iTunes][itunes-url]
or "[Apple Devices][apple-devices-url]" application on Windows OS or the built-in Finder application on MacOS[^1].

Motivation
----------

This tool is designed to use unencrypted local iOS backups as a reliable and incremental way to export photos and videos from iOS devices to your computer without relying on any cloud services. Frequent (even daily) iOS backups are very efficient because they are incremental (only new or changed files are added to the backup). Additionally, the tool itself is fully incremental: it never moves or overwrites files that have already been exported to the specified output directory.

**Note**: An unencrypted iOS backup won't contain most sensitive information from your iOS device. For example, passwords, Wi-Fi settings, website and call history, and health data are never transferred[^2]. So they are not as insecure as you might think. However, it is important to back up your iOS device data only to a fully secured computer.

Troubleshooting
---------------

**Problem:** I launched the command on MacOS and it shows the message "`ios_backup_extractor` cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified."\
**Solution:** You need to add this command to security exceptions following these steps:
 1. In the Finder on your Mac, locate the app where it has been extracted (unzipped). 
 2. Control-click the `ios_backup_extractor` icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu.
 3. Click Open. This opens the Terminal window, launches the application and saves a security exception for it.
 4. You can now run the tool from the command line as usual.

**Problem:** I run the tool on the MacOS and it says there are no iOS backups available or I see an error message
             about directory access.\
**Solution:** Go to Settings, `Security & Privacy` → `Full Disk Access` and enable "Full Disk Access" for your
              `Terminal` application.
